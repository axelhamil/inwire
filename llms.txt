# deps-injector

> Zero-ceremony dependency injection for TypeScript. Full inference, no decorators, no tokens.
> Proxy-based lazy singleton resolution. ~4.7KB gzipped, 0 runtime deps.

deps-injector uses factory functions `(container) => instance` as the single abstraction. Property access on the container triggers lazy resolution through a Proxy. Instances are cached as singletons by default. TypeScript infers the full container type from the factory definitions — no manual type wiring. Built-in introspection methods return serializable JSON, making the dependency graph directly consumable by LLMs and AI tooling.

## Core API

- `createContainer(defs)` — Creates a DI container from an object of factory functions. Returns a fully-typed Proxy.
- `transient(factory)` — Marks a factory as transient (new instance on every access, no caching).
- `detectDuplicateKeys(...modules)` — Detects keys that appear in more than one module object.

## Container Methods

- `.scope(extra)` — Creates a child container with additional deps. Child inherits parent singletons.
- `.extend(extra)` — Returns a new container with merged factories. Shares existing singleton cache.
- `.preload(...keys)` — Eagerly resolves specific dependencies. Only way to await async `onInit()`.
- `.inspect()` — Returns the full dependency graph as `ContainerGraph` (serializable JSON).
- `.describe(key)` — Returns `ProviderInfo` for a single provider.
- `.health()` — Returns `ContainerHealth` with warnings (e.g. scope mismatches).
- `.dispose()` — Calls `onDestroy()` on all resolved instances in LIFO order.

## Types

- `Container<T>` — Resolved deps + container methods
- `Factory<T>` — `(container: any) => T`
- `DepsDefinition` — `Record<string, Factory>`
- `ResolvedDeps<T>` — Maps each key to its factory's return type
- `OnInit` — Interface: `onInit(): void | Promise<void>`
- `OnDestroy` — Interface: `onDestroy(): void | Promise<void>`
- `ContainerGraph` — `{ providers: Record<string, ProviderInfo> }`
- `ContainerHealth` — `{ totalProviders, resolved, unresolved, warnings }`
- `ContainerWarning` — `{ type: 'scope_mismatch' | 'duplicate_key', message, details }`
- `ProviderInfo` — `{ key, resolved, deps, scope: 'singleton' | 'transient' }`

## Errors

All errors extend `ContainerError` and include `hint` (actionable fix) and `details` (structured context).

- `ContainerConfigError` — Non-function value in deps definition
- `ReservedKeyError` — Reserved container method name used as dependency key
- `ProviderNotFoundError` — Dependency not found during resolution (includes fuzzy suggestion)
- `CircularDependencyError` — Circular dependency detected in resolution chain
- `UndefinedReturnError` — Factory returned `undefined`
- `FactoryError` — Factory threw an error during resolution (wraps original error)
- `ScopeMismatchWarning` — Singleton depends on transient (warning, not error)
