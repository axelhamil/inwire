## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please use [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/axelhamil/inwire/security/advisories/new)** to report security issues.

Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### What to expect

- **Response time:** within 1 week (best-effort, solo maintainer)
- **Fix timeline:** depends on severity, but patches for confirmed issues are prioritized

### Scope

inwire has **zero runtime dependencies**, which keeps the attack surface minimal. Reports about transitive dev-dependency vulnerabilities are appreciated but lower priority.
